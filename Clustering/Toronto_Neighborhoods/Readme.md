# Clustering Toronto Neighborhoods
In this project, the objective is to cluster the 140 Toronto neighborhoods into clusters.
To complete this task, demographics data was acquired from the Canada Census that occurred in 2016.
The features used for clustering were the population density by square kilometer and the average household income for each of the neighborhoods.
